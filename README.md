# Maximus_the_Barbaric-


Maximus the Barbaric, or Maximus the Barber, or Maximus the Thirsty is a barbarian who loves beer but not all beer. He has limited tastes and does not like to try new things. Increase Maximus' anger if he gets the wrong beer.

Horrendous backstory:

Maximus worked in a brewing country where local brewers often allowed workers to bring their favourite beasts to work. He and his family owned a brewery that made MaxBrew for generations. One day their recipe was stolen by a terrible band of brewers named Tea_nuts. Tea_nuts envied Maximus' family's local brew but even with the recipe they failed to replicate. Rip-offs of MaxBrew flooded the country and now Maximus' rages when he finds out he's drinking fake MaxBrew.
